            With Diageo World Class 2015 Hong Kong & Macau Champion Antonio Lai at the helm,<br />
            expect the unexpected. Flavour and aroma combinations together with different textures,<br />
            appearances and even sounds will challenge every preconception held about cocktails — hence, a Multisensory experience.<br />
            The long bar extends to Antonio Lai’s lab showcasing the rotary evaporator and equipments redistilling and slow-cooking our own flavoured spirits,<br />
            and the caviar box for the signature Earl Grey Caviar Martini.
